# La Panthère: Optimized an existent website

This is a student project for OpenClassrooms Web Developer Path. The goal of this project is to optimize an existent website to improve performances, accessibility and SEO. In other words: it’s a legacy code you have to fix.

Warning: this is NOT an official correction by OpenClassrooms. This repo is only my work as a student. I am not responsible for any plagiarism if you use my code to validate the project.


## Process

On the start of the project, I got a code with (voluntary) lot of issues. To validate, I made a report of all issues, and I selected 14 corrections to improve as fast as possible the score on DevTool Lighthouse (I use this tool to have a Key Indicator Performance - KPI).

This repository contains the code after all the corrections I made. Keep in mind though: the code still has a lot of issues. But to validate this project, you don’t need to have a perfect website (which can take some time, and at this point, you rather want to restart from scratch).


### List of corrections

1.	Reduce image weight
2.	Update <meta>
3.	Update font for accessibility purposes
4.	Delete keyword stuffing
5.	Delete image with text and replace it with actual text
6.	Change <alt> for SEO purposes
7.	Fix footer
8.	Improve semantic HTML
9.	Optimize third party resources
10.	Give fixe size on images
11.	Fix navbar
12.	Define Aria Label
13.	Delete bugging scroll-to-top
14.	Update arborescence


## Deliverables

To add a little more context: this repository also contains PDF files: the first one “rapport_analyse_la_panthere_” list all the issues. The second report “rapport_optimisation_la_panthere” analyzes all the corrections I made. These documents are written in French.
